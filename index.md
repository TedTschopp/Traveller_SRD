# Core Rules

## Die Roll Conventions
**Check (or Throw):** To determine if a character succeeds or fails at a particular task, the player must make a check. To make a check, the player rolls 2d6 and adds any appropriate Dice Modifiers (such as a skill his character possesses, or a bonus from a piece of equipment). If the total is equal to or greater than the target number for that check, he succeeds. A check will usually have a skill or characteristic associated with it. For example, a check of ‘Dex 8+’ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Dexterity Characteristic Modifier, and you succeed if you have a total result of 8 or more’.

**Target Numbers:** In many checks, the player needs to roll equal to or above a specific number (usually, eight or more). This is denoted by a number followed by a plus, such as 8+ or 10+.

**Dice Modifier (abbreviated to DM):** A number to be applied to a die roll before it is used. Dice Modifiers are preceded by a sign, which indicates if the number is to be added to or subtracted from the roll. For example, a Dice Modifier of -2 indicates that two is to be subtracted from the roll; a Die Modifier of +4 indicates that four is to be added to the roll.

## Technology Levels
Technology Levels measure the scientific capacity of a world and the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment. TL 0: (Primitive) No technology. 
* TL 1: (Primitive) Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology. 
* TL 2: (Primitive) Renaissance technology. 
* TL 3: (Primitive) The advances of TL 2 are now applied, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power. 
* TL 4: (Industrial) The transition to industrial revolution is complete, bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions. 
* TL 5: (Industrial) TL 5 brings widespread electrification, tele-communications and internal combustion. 
* TL 6: (Industrial) TL 6 brings the development of fission power and more advanced computing. 
* TL 7: (Pre-Stellar) A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites. 
* TL 8: (Pre-Stellar) At TL 8, it is possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonisation are not within the culture’s capacity. 
* TL 9: (Pre-Stellar) The defining element of TL 9 is the development of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster. 
* TL 10: (Early Stellar) With the advent of Jump, nearby systems are opened up. 
* TL 11: (Early Stellar) The first true artificial intelligences become possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. 
* TL 12: (Average Stellar) Weather control revolutionises terraforming and agriculture. 
* TL 13: (Average Stellar) The battle dress appears on the battlefield in response to the new weapons. 
* TL 14: (Average Stellar) Fusion weapons become man-portable. 
* TL 15: (High Stellar) Black globe generators suggest a new direction for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic anagathics means that the human lifespan is now vastly increased. Higher Technology Levels exist and may appear in other settings or be discovered by pioneering scientists.

## Characteristics
Every person and creature in Traveller has several characteristics that describe their base mental and physical potential. 
Strength (Str): A character’s physical strength, fitness and forcefulness. 
Dexterity (Dex): Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes. 
Endurance (End): A character’s ability to sustain damage, stamina and determination. 
Intelligence (Int): A character’s intellect and quickness of mind. 
Education (Edu): A measure of a character’s learning and experience. 
Social Standing (Soc): A character’s place in society.

## Skills

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will suffer a -3 Dice Modifier when trying to use that skill. If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids the penalty for being untrained. If a character has one or more level in a skill (Level 1, Level 2, and so on) then he is trained in that skill. Each rank represents several years of experience using that skill. A character with Level 2-3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field. Some skills have specialities – specialised forms of that skill. A character picks a speciality when he gains level 1 in a skill with specialities. For example, a character might have Engineer 0, allowing him to make any Engineer skill checks without an unskilled penalty. He might then gain a level in Engineer, giving him Engineer (Jump drives) 1. He would make all Engineer checks involving Jump drives at a +1 DM, but would make all other Engineer checks at a +0 DM. A character can have multiple specialities in a skill – an engineer might have Engineer (Jump drives) 1 and Engineer (power plant) 2. He would make checks related to Jump drives with a +1 DM, checks related to power plants with a +2 DM and all other Engineer checks with a +0 DM.

### Task Checks

The Referee should only call for checks:

* when the characters are in danger.
* when the task is especially difficult or hazardous.
* when the characters are under the pressure of time.
* when success or failure is especially important or interesting.

To make a check, the player rolls 2d6 and any appropriate Dice Modifiers. If the total is 8 or more, the character succeeds. The most common forms of task checks are characteristic checks and skill checks. 

**Characteristic Check:** These checks are used when the task is one not covered by an obvious skill, or where the character’s innate abilities are the most important influence on the result. To make a Characteristic check, roll 2d6 and add the appropriate characteristic Dice Modifier. 

**Skill Check:** For a skill check, the character adds both his skill level and an appropriate characteristic DM. When making a skill check, if a character does not have any levels in that skill, then he suffers a -3 unskilled Dice Modifier.

### Task Difficulties

* **Simple** tasks have a difficulty DM of +6. 
* **Easy** tasks have a DM of +4. 
* **Routine** tasks have a difficulty DM of +2. 
* **Average** tasks have a difficulty DM of +0. 
* **Difficult** tasks have a difficulty DM of -2. 
* **Very difficult** tasks have a DM of -4. 
* **Formidable** tasks have a difficulty DM of -6

### Situational Modifiers

If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other beneficial circumstances, he receives a +1 DM to his skill check.

### Effect

If the degree of success is important, then subtract 8 from the total of the dice roll plus Dice Modifiers. This margin of success is referred to as the Effect.
#### Success

Effect Total | Success 
-------------|----------
 0           | **Marginal Success:** The character barely succeeds at the task, and may have to accept a condition on his success. He fixes the engine but it will overheat. He finds a buyer for the goods but the buyer is a untrustworthy criminal. 
 1 to 5      | **Average Success:** The character succeeds normally. 
 6 or more   | **Exceptional Success:** The character succeeds in an impressive and elegant fashion.

#### Failure

Effect Total | Success 
------------|----------
 -6 or less | **Exceptional Failure:** The character failed as completely as it is possibly to fail. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. If attempting to repair a device, the device is further damaged or even destroyed. In a social situation, the character gets into further trouble.
 -2 to -5   | **Average Failure:** The character has failed the task. 
 -1         | **Marginal Failure:** The character has almost, almost succeeded, and the Referee may permit him to scrape a success if he takes a significant consequence. A character trying to jump across a chasm hangs onto the far side by his fingernails but can only pull himself up if he drops his backpack. A character trying to land a ship can bring it down safely but the ship may never fly again. A character hacking a computer gets in but the security programs can trace his location.


### Timing
To determine how long a task takes, roll 1d6 and multiply it by the increment listed for that action.

### Going Faster or Slower

You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you a -1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time taken gives you a +1 DM for every row you move.

### Multiple Actions

A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a spacecraft’s weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he suffers a -2 DM to all skill checks.

### Opposed Checks

If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the character who obtains the highest Effect wins.
Aiding Another Character
The result of one check can give a DM to the next.

#### Task Chain DMs

Effect Total | Success 
------------|----------
 -6 or less | **Exceptional Failure:** The character failed as completely as it is possibly to fail. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. If attempting to repair a device, the device is further damaged or even destroyed. In a social situation, the character gets into further trouble.
 -2 to -5   | **Average Failure:** The character has failed the task. 
 -1         | **Marginal Failure:** The character has almost, almost succeeded, and the Referee may permit him to scrape a success if he takes a significant consequence. A character trying to jump across a chasm hangs onto the far side by his fingernails but can only pull himself up if he drops his backpack. A character trying to land a ship can bring it down safely but the ship may never fly again. A character hacking a computer gets in but the security programs can trace his location.

Previous Check |New DM | Previous Check | New DM
---------------+-------+-----------------+-------
Effect -6 or less | -3 | Effect 0        | +0
Effect -2 to -5   | -2 | Effect 1 to 5   | +1
Effect -1	        | -1 | Effect 6 or more| +2

### Learning New Skills

A character’s Skill Total is calculated by summing the levels of each skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character with Mechanic 1 and Gun Combat (slug pistols) 2 would have a Skill Total of 3. To increase a skill, a character must train for a number of weeks equal to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So, to advance from Pilot 2 to Pilot 3 with a current Skill Total of 3 would take (three, plus three) six weeks. A character may only train one skill in a given week. The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned.  

### Background Skills

Before embarking on your careers, you get a number of background skills equal to 3 + your Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your Education score). 

#### Homeworld Skills

### Careers

At many points during a career, a character will have to make a throw of some sort. Most of these throws are characteristic throws – roll 2d6, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher than the listed value. A throw of Int 8+ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Intelligence DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more’. A few throws are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic. For example, a throw of Gunnery 8+ would mean ‘roll 2d6, add your Gunnery skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic such as Dexterity, and get over 8’.

#### Career Format

**Qualification**: What you need to roll to enter that career. Military careers use Enlistment as the description for this roll instead of qualification. If you fail this check then you cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the Draft or take the Drifter career for this term. You suffer a -1 DM to qualification rolls for each previous career you have entered. Once you leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from and the Drifter career is always open. 

**Skills and Training**: Each career has skill tables associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1d6 to see which skill you increase. You may only roll on Advanced Skills if your character has the listed qualification (usually Education 8+ or a certain Rank). You may only roll on the Officer Skills if your career has one and if you have received a commission. Skills can be listed with or without an associated level. If no rank is listed, then you gain that skill at Level 1 if you do not have it already, or increases its level by one if you are already trained in that field. If a rank is listed, then you gain the skill at that level as long as it is better than your current level in that skill. 

**Basic Training**: For your first career only, you get all the skills listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. For any subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. 

**Survival**: Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, roll on the mishap table. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave the service. You lose the benefit roll for the current term only. A natural 2 is always a failure. 

**Events**: If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll on the events table to see what interesting things befall you this term. 

**Commission**: This only applies to the military careers of Army, Navy and Marines. A character who succeeds at a commission roll becomes a Rank 1 officer in that career, and uses the officer Rank table from then on. A character may attempt a commission roll once per term, and trying for commission is optional. If you obtain a commission after having already advanced several ranks, you become a Rank 1 officer as normal but you may add your two final ranks together for the purposes of determining benefits and pensions. Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls, or give automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to commission rolls also. 

**Advancement**: Each career has an advancement roll. If you make a successful Advancement roll, then you move to the next rank and gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training Tables for this career. You also get any benefits listed for your new rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term. If your result is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new challenge. If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career. 

**Ranks and Benefits**: You start at Rank 0 in your career. Each time you succeed at an advancement check, you move onto the next Rank. Some ranks have benefits associated with them, such as extra skills or more benefits. You gain these benefits as soon as you attain that rank. 

**Mustering-Out Benefits**: When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material benefits from that career. There are two tables – Cash and Benefits. You may only roll on the cash tables a maximum of three times, regardless of how many careers or benefit rolls you have. You get one benefit roll per full term served. Leaving due to a mishap means you lose the benefit roll for that term, but not previous full terms in that career. If you reached rank 1 or 2, you get an extra benefit roll when leaving that service. If you reached rank 3 or 4, you get two extra benefit rolls, and if you reached rank 5 or 6, you get three extra benefit rolls and may apply a +1 to rolls on the Benefits table that you gain from that career.

* Courier

##### Mishaps

1d6 | Mishap
----|------
1   | Severely injured in action. (This is the same as a result of 2 on the Injury table.) Alternatively, roll twice on the Injury table and take the lower result.
2   | Psychologically damaged by your time in the scouts. Reduce your Intelligence or Social Standing by 1.
3   | Your ship is damaged, and you have to hitch-hike your way back across the stars to the nearest scout base. Gain 1d6 Contacts and 1d3 Enemies.
4   | You inadvertently cause a conflict between the Imperium and a minor world or race. Gain a Rival and Diplomat 1.
5   | You have no idea what happened to you – they found your ship drifting on the fringes of friendly space.

##### Events

2d6 | Events
----|-------
2   | Disaster! Roll on the mishap table, but you are not ejected from this career.
3   | Your ship is ambushed by enemy vessels. Either run, and throw Pilot 8+ to escape, or treat with them and throw Persuade 10+ to bargain with them. If you fail the check, then your ship is destroyed and you may not re-enlist in the Scouts at the end of this term. If you succeed, you survive and gain Sensors 1. Either way, gain an Enemy.
4   | You survey an alien world. Gain one of Animals (riding or training) 1, Survival 1, Recon 1 or Life Science (any) 1
5   | You perform an exemplary service for the scouts. Gain a +1 DM to any one Benefit roll.

If you succeed, gain an Ally in the Imperium and a +2 DM to your next Advancement roll. If you fail, roll on the Mishap table, but you are not ejected from this career.
9   | Your scout ship is one of the first on the scene to rescue the survivors of a disaster. Roll either Medic 8+ or Engineer 8+. If you succeed, gain a Contact and a +2 DM to your next Advancement check. If you fail, gain an Enemy.
10  | You spend a great deal of time on the fringes of known space. Roll Survival 8+ or Pilot 8+. If you succeed, gain a Contact in an alien race and one level in any skill of your choice. If you fail, roll on the Mishap table.
11  | You serve as the courier for an important message from the Imperium. Either gain one level of Diplomat, or take a +4 DM to your next Advancement roll.
12  | You discover a world, item or information of worth to the Imperium. You are automatically promoted.

#### Drifters and The Draft

You may attempt to enlist in one career each term if you are not continuing on in an existing career. If you fail to for a new career, you have two options. You can apply to the Draft and be randomly sent to one of the military services or you may spend that term travelling through known space as a Drifter without a career or purpose. A character may only enter the Draft once.

##### Draft Table

1d6 | Career (specialty)
1   | Navy (any)
2   | Army (any)
3   | Marines (any)
4   | Merchants (merchant marine)
5   | Scouts (any)
6   | Agent (law enforcement)

#### Life Events

If you roll a Life Event on the Events table for your career, roll on the Life Events table.

#### Mustering Out Benefits

Benefits are gained when a character leaves a career for any reason other than failing a survival roll. You may only roll on the Cash table a maximum of three times no matter how many careers you have had.

##### Cash Benefits

A character with the Gambler skill at level 1 or better gets a +1 DM to all rolls on the Cash table. If the character has any money after rolling on the Cash table then he may purchase personal equipment worth up to 2,000 credits immediately.

##### Other Benefits

When you leave a career in good standing with your previous employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment or even shares of a vessel.

##### Retirement Pay

A character that leaves a service at the end of the 5th or later term of service may receive retirement pay.

Terms | Pay
------|----
5     | Cr. 10,000
6     | Cr. 12,000
7     | Cr. 14,000
8     | Cr. 16,000
9+    | +2,000 per term beyond 8

#### Ageing

The effects of ageing begin when a character reaches 34 years of age. At the end of the fourth term, and at the end of every term thereafter, the character must roll 2d6 on the Ageing Table. Apply the character’s total number of terms as a negative Dice Modifier on this table.

Aging Table

2d6 | Effects of Aging
----|-------------------
\-6 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2, reduce one mental characteristic by 1
\-5 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2.
\-4 | Reduce two physical characteristics by 2, reduce one physical characteristic by 1
\-3 | Reduce one physical characteristic by 2, reduce two physical characteristic by 1
\-2 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 1
\-1 | Reduce two physical characteristics by 1
  0 | Reduce one physical characteristic by 1
 1+ | No effect

**Ageing Crisis**: If any characteristic is reduced to 0 by ageing, then the character suffers an ageing crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms. **Anagathics**: While using anagathic drugs, the character effectively does not age – add the number of terms since the character started taking anagathics as a positive Dice Modifier to rolls on the ageing table. If a character stops taking anagathics, then he must roll immediately on the ageing table to simulate the shock that comes from his system beginning to age again. The risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to the character’s biochemistry means the character must make a second Survival check if he passes his first Survival check in a term. If either check is failed, the character suffers a mishap and is ejected from the career. The drugs cost 1d6 x 2,500 Credits for each term that the character uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the character’s eventual mustering-out cash benefits. If the character cannot pay these bills, he goes into debt.

#### Injuries

Characters that are wounded in combat or accidents during character creation must roll on the Injury table.

Injury Table

1d6 | Injury
----|-------
1   | Nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6, reduce both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of them by 4).
2   | Severely injured. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6.
3   | Missing eye or limb. Reduce Strength or Dexterity by 2.
4   | Scarred. You are scarred and injured. Reduce any one physical characteristic by 2.
5   | Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.
6   | Lightly injured. No permanent effect.

**Injury Crisis**: If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the character suffers an injury crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms. **Medical Care**: If your character has been injured, then medical care may be able to undo the effects of damage. The restoration of a lost characteristic costs 5,000 Credits per point. If your character was injured in the service of a patron or organisation, then a portion of his medical care may be paid for by that patron. Roll 2d6 on the table below, adding your Rank as a DM. The result is how much of his medical care is paid for by his employer.

Medical Bills 

Career                                              | Roll of 4+ | Roll of 8+ | Roll of 12+
----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------
Army/Navy/Marines                                   | 75%        | 100%       | 100%
Agent/Nobility/Scholar/Entertainer/Merchant/Citizen | 50%        | 75%        | 100%
Scout/Rogue/Drifter                                 | 0%         | 50%        | 75%

**Medical Debt**: During finishing touches, you must pay any outstanding costs from medical care or anagathic drugs out of your Benefits before anything else.

#### Finalise Connections


The connections between characters rule can give you bonus skills. At this stage, you may make (or finalise) a connection between your character and up to two other player characters. For each connection you make, you may gain one level in any skill, but you cannot bring a skill above level 3 using this rule nor may you take the Jack of all Trades skill.

### Aliens

TODO: Change to Mutations or something along those lines.  Not Aliens

Alien species may have different criteria for Social Standing: Caste or Charisma. When dealing with a race that has a different concept of Social Standing, all DMs from Social Standing or its alien equivalent – whether positive or negative – are halved. In addition to their characteristics, aliens may have one or more alien traits.

**Armored**: The alien possess thick fur, scales, a bony exoskeleton or other natural protection that gives it one point of natural armor.

**Aquatic**: The alien is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Endurance x 10 minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is halved on land. If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot operate out of water without mechanical aid or telepresence.

**Atmospheric Requirements**: The species requires an unusual combination of gasses to breathe, and cannot survive in most atmospheres without artificial aid.

**Engineered**: The species has been altered by some external factor to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment. Medical treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower Technology Level than that at which the species was created receives a negative DM equal to the difference.

**Fast Metabolism**: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled. In combat, fast-metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative bonus. Fast-metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes of determining fatigue.

**Feral**: Feral species are uncivilised, regardless of their technological knowledge. Feral species roll Education on 1d6 only.

**Flyer**: The species can fly using wings, glider membranes, gasbags or other means. Characters of this species gain the Athletics (flying) skill at Level 0 and can travel at a speed noted in their description. Flying creatures who are aloft must spend one minor action every round on movement or stall and fall out of the air.

* Winged flight is tiring and can only be sustained for a number of rounds equal to the creature’s Endurance before requiring a like amount of rest. Some specialised avians can increase this to minutes or even hours equal to Endurance.
* Species with glider membranes cannot gain altitude while flying. They descend one metre every time they move forwards and cannot use more than one minor action for flying movement in a round.
* Species that float using gasbags or some other method do not need to move to remain aloft.

**Large**: The species is considerably larger than the average for sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of 3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for Large creatures are doubled.

* Some Large creatures are described as Huge. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a +1 DM to hit.

**Natural Weapon**: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws, a strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons are usable at Personal range and deal +1 damage. The creature gains Melee (natural weapons) at level 0.

**No Fine Manipulators**: The species has no fingers or other prehensile appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up, pushing small buttons, reaching into tight spaces, and so on.

**Notable (Characteristic)**: Some species are notably dextrous, intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a positive Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (+2 unless otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that characteristic is increased by the same amount.

**Psionic**: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character generation.

**Small**: Small species generally have a Strength and Endurance of only 1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6. The minimum size for a sophont is about half that of a human, Some Small creatures are described as Tiny. Attacks against Tiny creatures receive a -1 DM to hit.

**Slow Metabolism**: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less food than most species, and their life support costs are halved. In combat, slow-metabolism creatures suffer a -2 initiative penalty.

**Uplifted**: This species was originally non-sentient, but has been raised to a higher intelligence by another species. Uplifted races generally become client species of their patron. Two common uplifted animals are apes and dolphins:

* Uplifted apes have Notable Strength and Endurance (+2) but all other characteristics are Weak (-2). They have the Uplifted trait.
* Uplifted dolphins have Notable Strength (+4) and Notable Endurance (+2) but Weak Intelligence, Education and Social Standing (-2). They have the Uplifted, Aquatic (fully aquatic, air-breathers) and No Fine Manipulators traits.

**Weak (Characteristic)**: The opposite of Notable (Characteristic), some species are weaker, less resilient or less well educated than others. Characters from such races have a negative Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (-2 unless otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that characteristic is decreased by the same amount.

### Combat

If the combatants are all unprepared for combat, then each rolls 2d6 and adds their Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative. Initiative determines the order that characters act in, but it can also be spent to react to events. If some of the combatants are ready for combat and some are not, such as in an ambush, the prepared characters are considered to get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM. Characters who have the Tactics skill may make a Tactics check and add the Effect of this check to the Initiative of everyone in their unit.

##### The Combat Round

Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time. In a combat round each character gets a minor action and a significant action. Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two characters have the same Initiative, the character with the highest Dexterity goes first. If they are still tied, then characters act simultaneously. When a character acts, he takes all his actions at once. Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round begins. Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and down by actions taken during a round.

##### Dynamic Initiative

During the course of a round a character’s Initiative score may be changed by reactions, recoil and hastening. Any changes affect your Initiative for one round only – either the current round if you have yet to act or the following round if you have acted already. Reactions reduce your Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from attacks. Recoil slows you down if you are using a weapon heavier than you can handle. Hastening your action lets you act sooner but at a penalty to your roll. At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he is acting hastily. This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that round only but all his actions receive a -1 DM. A character can only hasten once.

#### Minor Actions

##### Movement

The character moves up to six metres. Difficult terrain, such as rubble, mud or thick underbrush can halve a character’s movement, allowing him to move only three metres per movement action. Crouching also halves movement.

##### Changing Stance

A character can change to any one of the three stances – prone, crouched or standing – as a minor action.

##### Drawing and Reloading

The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of use. The number of minor actions to ready or reload a weapon is listed in the description of each weapon. Most weapons take one minor action to draw and another minor action to reload, but some weapons are especially fast or slow.

##### Aiming

A character who spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a +1 DM to his next attack on the target, as long as the character does nothing except aim until he makes his attack. A character may spend multiple actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming DM of +6 if he spends six minor actions on aiming.

##### Miscellaneous

The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the character’s full attention or complex physical actions.

#### Significant Actions

##### Minor Actions

A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

##### Miscellaneous

A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when such an action requires the character’s full attention, concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof.

##### Attack

The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack action is trying to injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged weapon. The attacker declares his target, and the foe may choose to react. The attacker then makes a skill check, and if successful, deals damage to his target. As with any other skill check, the standard roll for success is 8+. The standard skill checks used in making an attack are: **Melee Attack = 2d6 + Melee (appropriate specialty) + Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker’s choice)** **Shooting Attack = 2d6 + Gun Combat (appropriate specialty) or Heavy Weapons (appropriate specialty) + Dexterity DM** **Thrown Attack = 2d6 + Athletics (co-ordination) + Dexterity DM**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Common Modifiers to Attacks
| Action/Item | Bonuses | Effect | Penalties |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aiming | +1 per Aim action | Cover | -0 to -6 |
| Laser Sight | +1 if aiming | Movement | -1 for every 10 full metres of target movement |
| Intelligent Weapon | +1 if total DM is within the program’s tolerance | Target Dodges (Reaction) | -1  |
|     |     | Environmental Effects | -1 to -2 |
|     |     | Range | -0 to -6 |
|     |     | Target Stance | -2 if attacking a prone target at Medium or greater range if attacking a prone target at Personal range |
|     |     | Target Parries (Reaction) | -Defender’s Melee skill |

##### Recoil and Heft

When you make an attack, compare your Strength DM to the Recoil rating of the weapon you are using. If your Strength DM is lower then the difference is applied to your initiative next round. Melee weapons have a rating called Heft which works in exactly the same way. When firing automatic weapons in burst mode, increase Recoil by 1. When firing them on full auto increase Recoil by half the Auto score.

#### Reactions


The more time a character spends reacting, the longer it will be until he acts himself. Each reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and applies a -1 DM to all skill checks until the following round. There is no limit to how many times a character can react in a round but a character can only react once to each attack and the penalties from reacting are cumulative. A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of.

##### Dodging

A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a -1 DM and giving himself a -1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. If the character is in cover or has an obstruction to duck or dodge behind, the DM to hit him is increased to -2.

##### Parrying

A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his Melee skill as a negative DM equal to the attack roll. A parrying character also has a -1 DM on all skill checks until the next round.

#### Other Actions

##### Free Actions

Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor action – shouting a warning, pushing a button, checking your watch, and so on. A character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action on his various tasks.

##### Extended Actions

Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round to complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six second combat rounds it will take to complete. A character engaging in an extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes (after armour). Failure indicates that this round’s work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character must start again.

##### Delay

A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the Initiative order. He may act at any later point during the round, even interrupting another’s actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has not acted by the end of the round he may choose to act first in the next round, effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following round, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in Dexterity order as normal.

#### Special Considerations

##### Automatic Weapons

Automatic weapons – any with a number listed in the Auto column are capable of three fire modes: single-shot, burst, and auto-fire.

* When using single shots, make attacks as normal.
* When using burst fire, add the Auto value to the damage. Burst fire uses a number of rounds equal to the Auto rating.
* When using auto-fire, roll a number of dice equal to the Auto rating of the weapon and sort them into pairs as you wish. Each pair is an attack. Auto-fire attacks can be allocated to as many different targets as you have attacks provided all the targets are within six metres of each other. Auto-fire attacks cannot benefit from a skill any higher than level 1. Weapon skills of 2 or higher only count as 1 when making auto-fire attacks. Auto-fire uses a number of rounds equal to 3 x the Auto rating.

##### Battlefield Comms

Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefield. If a character is not in communication with the rest of his unit and his commander, then he cannot benefit from Tactics or Leadership. Characters who benefitted from Tactics at the start of combat and are later cut off from their commander have their Initiative lowered by the same amount it was boosted at the start of combat. Unlike other Initiative modifications, this lasts until combat ends or communication is re-established. There are several methods of communication:

* **Direct**: This covers hand signals and verbal communications.
* **Hardlinks**: Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections, and cannot be jammed.
* **Radio**: Radio communications allow communications as long as the radio signal can get through – they can be jammed or blocked by local conditions.
* **Laser**: Two characters with tight beam lasers are in communication as long as line of sight exists between a character and another friendly laser-comm equipped character.
* **Masers**: These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke and aerosols.
* **Meson**: Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked, but cannot be used while a character is moving.

##### Battlefield Sensors

There are several types of sensors.

* **Bioscanner**: Bioscanner ‘sniffers’ detect airborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals.
* **Infra-Red (Heat)**:Infra-red sensors detect warm bodies, and negate concealment from smoke and soft cover, but can be jammed by strong heat sources.
* **Densitometer**: An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a densitometer can scan an area and plot variable densities, effectively creating a three-dimensional map of all objects.
* **Electromagnetic Detectors**: These sensors can detect unshielded high-power electrical devices, such as gauss weapons or transmitters.
* **Laser-Assisted Targeting**: A low-powered laser is reflected off the target, giving targeting data to the firer.
* **Light Intensification**: Light intensification technology magnifies visible light, negating the penalties for darkness or low light.
* **Motion Sensors**: Can detect motion within range.
* **Neural Activity Sensor**: A combination of highly sensitive EM-detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick up on the brain activity of living beings and classifies them according to amount and complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence of subjects.

##### Certain battlefield conditions affect ranged attacks:

* **Darkness**: Low light gives a -1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete darkness gives a -4 DM. Light penalties can be avoided by using sensors to target instead of the naked eye.
* **Smoke or Fog**: Smoke gives a -1 DM to ranged attacks by obscuring the target; especially thick and impenetrable smoke gives a -2 DM. These penalties are doubled for laser weapons.
* **Extreme Weather**: Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a -1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a -1 DM to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility penalty.

##### Cover

Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects can serve as cover. Attacks made on characters who are behind cover suffer the negative cover DM on the table below. Crouching or prone targets (see overleaf) can claim cover one step higher on the table. If a character in full cover is crouching or prone they are impossible to hit but cannot return fire.

| Cover | Cover DM |
| --- | --- |
| 1/4 (undergrowth, small rock, corner of a building) | -0  |
| 1/2 (thick forest, low wall, crate) | -1  |
| 3/4 (jungle, trench, reinforced position) | -2  |
| Full (pillbox) | -4  |

##### Explosions

Grenades, rockets and other explosives affect an area. A character caught in an explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost. A character who dodges an explosion may reduce the damage by 1d6 if he just dodges or by half if he dives for cover. A character who dives for cover ends up prone and loses his next significant action.

##### Firing into Combat

If a character is firing a weapon at a target who is at Personal range to another combatant, then the attack suffers a -2 DM. If the attack misses, roll 1d6. On a 4+, the attack hits the nearest other combatant to the original target.

##### Grappling

A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of hitting him. The attacker must move to Personal range and beat his target in an opposed Melee (unarmed) check. If he wins, he may do any one of the following:

* Knock his opponent prone.
* Disarm his opponent. If he succeeds by 6+ he can take the weapon away; otherwise it ends up on the floor.
* Throw his opponent up to three metres for 1d6 damage.
* Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect.
* Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement action).
* Continue the grapple with no other effects.
* Drag his opponent up to three metres.

Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other option the winner can choose to end or continue the grapple as he sees fit. A character in a grapple cannot move or do anything other than make opposed Melee checks. Each time an opposed check is made the winner can choose an option from the above list.

##### Range

Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands:

| Range | Distance to Target | Squares to Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal | Less than 1.5 metres | 0 (combatants are in the same square) |
| Close | 1.5 to 3 metres | 1 to 2 squares |
| Short | 3 to 12 metres | 3 to 8 squares |
| Medium | 12 to 50 metres | 9 to 34 squares |
| Long | 51 metres to 250 metres | 35 to 166 squares |
| Very Long | 251 metres to 500 metres | 167 to 334 squares |
| Distant | 501 metres+ | 334 squares+ |

##### Stance

A character can be standing, crouched or prone. A standing character uses the normal rules. A crouching character moves at half speed but can make better use of cover. If a crouching character is in cover, consider it one row lower on the Cover. A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may make improved use of cover like a crouching character and he may still parry melee attacks. All ranged attacks targeting him suffer a -2 DM penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced to +0; a prone character being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to attacks against him.

##### Tactics and Leadership

The Tactics skill can be used to give an Initiative bonus to a whole unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a Tactics check, and everyone in the unit may increase their Initiative by the Effect of the check. The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character’s Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check, and the target character’s Initiative is increased by the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a significant action.

##### Thrown Weapons

There are two kinds of thrown weapons: the first kind strike a single target and do damage from the force of their impact, such as throwing knives or a thrown rock. These use the normal rules for ranged combat. The other kind of thrown weapon is a grenade or other explosive projectile that inflicts no damage from impact but typically delivers a harmful payload. The first kind of thrown weapon adds the Effect of the Athletics (co-ordination) check to its damage. The second does not. If the attack fails the projectile scatters in a random direction for (6 + Effect) metres. This is usually only important if the projectile explodes on or after impact.

##### Damage

Each weapon lists the damage it inflicts as a number of d6. Add the Effect of the attack roll to this damage. Damage is applied initially to the target’s Endurance. If a target is reduced to Endurance 0, then further damage is subtracted from the target’s Strength or Dexterity. If either Strength or Dexterity is reduced to 0, the character is unconscious and any further damage is subtracted from the remaining physical characteristic. If all three physical characteristics are reduced to 0, the character is killed.

##### Armour

Armour reduces damage by the value of the armour. A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the target’s armour.

#### Vehicles

Combat in and on vehicles is much the same as ordinary combat. The differences are as follows:

* Unlike people, who are mobile and manoeuvrable, careful track must be kept of which way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted weapons – and armed passengers, to a lesser extent – are restricted to certain fire arcs.
* Vehicles are considered to move on the driver’s Initiative. The driver must spend a minor action every round to keep control of the vehicle under normal circumstances – a straight road or simple manoeuvres – or a significant action to navigate obstacles, conduct evasion or pursuit, or dodge incoming fire.
* Attackers gain a +1 DM to hit most vehicles because of their size.

##### Types of Vehicles

There are two main types of vehicles: open and closed. Closed Vehicles

* Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants – unless the description mentions otherwise civilian vehicles grant  ½ soft cover and military vehicles full hard cover.
* Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of windows or other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the description mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc from a civilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one.

Open Vehicles

* Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers.
* Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction.

##### Vehicle-Mounted Weapons

Weapons mounted on vehicles are limited in what directions they can fire. A weapon mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into a 90? area in front of the vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction.

##### Collisions

When a vehicle collides with something else everything takes damage. Roll 1d6 for every 10 km/h of the vehicle’s speed (round up). This is applied as damage directly to anything hit and, if the thing struck is solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured passengers in a vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible, are thrown three metres for every 10 km/h of speed. Secured passengers (those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere and take one quarter damage.

##### Vehicular Actions

These are all significant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take when his turn in the initiative order arrives.

##### Evasive Action

Vehicles are not typically manoeuvrable enough to dodge as a reaction. Instead, the driver may declare that he is taking evasive action when his turn arrives. He makes a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) and the Effect acts as a -DM to all attacks against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a -DM to any attacks made from the vehicle as well. This lasts until the driver’s next action.

##### Manoeuvring

A driver or pilot can manoeuvre his vehicle without making a skill check. This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to get where it is going, to move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and into a different one, or to change the fire arc that a single target is in.

##### Ram

Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a significant action and a successful skill check (skill determined by vehicle). Rams are affected by dodging and evasive action as normal. The Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare it automatically successful if the target is particularly large.

##### Stunt

With a significant action and a successful vehicle control check the driver or pilot of a vehicle can do pretty much anything it is possible to do in his vehicle – stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc for one round, to set up some other skill check using the rules for task chains, to achieve something that would normally be difficult or impossible in your vehicle, to achieve up to three manoeuvre actions in one go, just to show off, or anything else you can imagine.

##### Weave

In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his vehicle in and around the obstacles at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The driver chooses a weaving number, as low as one or as high as one per 20 km/h of speed (round up), and must then make a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving number as a penalty on his roll. If he fails, he has woven into an obstacle and crashed. If he succeeds, any pursuers must choose a weave action when their initiative count comes up and make their skill test at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure. Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up or try to reacquire the target later.

##### Vehicle Damage

Vehicles have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the vehicle’s structural integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle starts taking damage to its internal systems. When Structure is reduced to 0, the vehicle is reduced to scrap. Vehicles also suffer damage to onboard systems as they take damage. To determine the effects of an attack on a vehicle, first determine how much damage the vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles will have one or more points of armour that reduces the damage. Consult the Vehicle Damage table to determine how many ‘hits’ the vehicle suffers.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Vehicle Damage Table
| Damage | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 0 or less | No damage |
| 1-3 | Single Hit |
| 4-6 | Two Single Hits |
| 7-9 | Double Hit |
| 10-12 | Three Single Hits |
| 13-15 | Two Single Hits, Double Hit |
| 16-18 | Two Double Hits |
| 19-21 | Triple Hit |
| 22-24 | Triple Hit, Single Hit |
| 25-27 | Triple Hit, Double Hit |
| 28-30 | Triple Hit, Double Hit, Single Hit |
| 31-33 | Two Triple Hits |
| For every extra three points | +1 Single Hit |
| For every extra six points | +1 Double Hit |

Each hit is then applied to a particular location on the vehicle. Double or Triple hits count as two or three hits on the same location.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |Location Table
| 2d6 | External Hit (vehicle) | Internal Hit (Vehicle) | Robot or Drone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 9   | Weapon | Cargo | Weapon or Limb |
| 10  | Drive | Computers | Drive |
| 11  | Sensors | Cockpit | Sensors |
| 12  | Hull | Cockpit | Computer |

##### Hull

Reduce the vehicle or drone’s Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of Hull, further Hull hits become hits on the same row of the Internal Damage table (if a vehicle) or Structure hits (if a robot or drone).

##### Structure

Reduce the vehicle or drone’s Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out of Structure, it is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack that reduces it to a negative Structure score it explodes, doing 4d6 damage to everyone within six metres (including the occupants) and 2d6 damage to everyone within twelve metres. The occupants of a closed vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion but the occupants of an open vehicle can.

##### Armour

Reduce the vehicle’s armour by one.

##### Drive

* _First Hit:_ Reduce movement by 10% and apply a -1 DM to all vehicle control skill checks.
* _Second Hit:_ Reduce movement by 25% and apply a -2 DM to all vehicle control skill checks.
* _Third Hit:_ Drive disabled.
* Further drive hits count as Hull hits.

##### Weapon

Choose a weapon or device randomly for each hit.

* _First Hit:_ The weapon or device suffers a -2 DM to all checks related to its operation.
* _Second Hit:_ The weapon or device is destroyed.
* If no weapons remain to be destroyed, further hits on this location become Hull hits.

##### Sensors

* _First Hit:_ The vehicle or drone suffers a -2 DM to all Sensors checks. For drones and robots, this also applies to Recon checks.
* _Second Hit:_ The sensors are destroyed, blinding the vehicle or drone.
* Further Sensor hits count as Hull hits.

##### Power Plant

* _First Hit_: The vehicle or drone loses one round’s worth of actions.
* _Second Hit:_ The vehicle or drone’s movement is reduced by 50%.
* _Third Hit:_ The power plant is destroyed, disabling the vehicle and inflicting 1d6 Hull hits on it.

##### Limb

Choose a limb randomly for each limb hit.

* _First Hit:_ The limb suffers a -2 DM to all checks related to its operation.
* _Second Hit:_ The limb is destroyed.
* Further Limb hits count as Hull hits.

##### Passengers

Choose a passenger randomly for any passenger hit. The passenger takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If all the passengers are dead, further passenger hits become Structure hits.

##### Cargo

Any cargo present is hit and may be destroyed. If no cargo remains, further cargo hits become Structure hits.

##### Cockpit

The pilot of the vehicle is hit, and takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If the pilot is dead, further pilot hits become Structure hits.

##### Computer

* _First Hit:_ The vehicle’s computer system is disabled. A drone or robot with a disabled computer system shuts down for 1d6 rounds.
* _Second Hit:_ The vehicle’s computer system is destroyed. A drone or robot with no computer system is completely disabled.
* Further Computer hits count as Structure hits.

#### Repairs

Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories – System Damage, Hull Damage, and Structure Damage. 

**System Damage**: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1d6 hours. Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill check (Mechanic, Engineer (appropriate speciality) or Science (appropriate speciality)) taking 1-6 hours but also a source of spare parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap yard, a workshop, systems on another vehicle, or can be taken from other systems on the same vehicle. When taking spare parts from other vehicle systems, each ‘hit’ of damage provides enough spare parts to make a single repair check. The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide spare parts, although cybernetic parts might be able to provide enough spare material to repair minor damage. A destroyed system costs 2d6 x 10% of its original cost to repair, and cannot be repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and specialist materials. 

**Hull Damage**: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanic check taking 1-6 hours and consumes one ‘hit’ of spare parts. 

**Structure Damage**: Structure damage can only be repaired in a workshop and requires 10-60 hours per point of damage. It costs 20% of the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill check is required.

Animals
=======



Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there are several differences: 

**Instinct**: Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals apply their Instinct DM to tasks such as sensing prey or solving problems. 

**Pack**: Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher a creature’s Pack score, the larger the group that it is associated with, and the more standing the creature has in that group.

Behaviours
----------

Terran creatures that exemplify these behaviours are noted in brackets after the name. Characteristic modifiers and skills are noted after the description – the exact level of skills varies depending on the particular creature. 

**Carrion-Eater (vulture)**: Scavengers which wait for all other threats to disperse before beginning. Carrion-eaters have Recon. Instinct +2. 

**Chaser (wolf)**: Animals which kill their prey by attacking and exhausting it after a chase. Chasers have Athletics (co-ordination and/or endurance). Dexterity +4, Instinct +2, Pack +2. 

**Eater (army ant)**: Eaters will eat anything they encounter, including characters. Endurance +4. Pack +2. 

**Filter (earthworm)**: Herbivores which pass their environment through their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move to food, filters move a flow of matter through themselves and filter out the food. Endurance +4. 

**Gatherer (raccoon, chimpanzee)**: Gatherers are herbivores that collect and store food. Gatherers have Stealth. Pack +2. 

**Grazer (antelope)**: Grazers move from food source to food source, often in large packs. Their primary form of defence tends to be fleeing danger. Instinct +2, Pack +4. 

**Hunter (baboon)**: Opportunistic predators that stalk easy prey. Hunters have Survival. Instinct +2. 

**Hijacker (lion)**: Scavengers which steal the kills of others through brute force or weight of numbers are hijackers. Strength +2, Pack +2. 

**Intimidator (coyote)**: Scavengers which establish their claim to food by frightening or intimidating other creatures. Intimidators have Persuade. 

**Killer (shark)**: Carnivores that possess a raw killing instinct, attacking in a frenzied manner. Killers have Melee and either Strength or Dexterity +4, Instinct +4, Pack -2. 

**Intermittent (elephant)**: Herbivores that do not devote their entire time to searching for food. Intermittents have Pack +4. 

**Pouncer (cat)**: Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey. Pouncers have Stealth, Recon and Athletics. Dexterity +4, Instinct +4. 

**Reducer (vermin)**: Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all available food, devouring even the remains left by other scavengers. Pack +4 

**Siren (venus fly-trap)**: Sirens create a lure to attract prey. Usually, this lure will be specific to the species the siren preys on, but some rare lures are universal. Sirens have Deception. Pack -4 

**Trapper (spider)**: An animal which allows its prey to enter a trap. Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in its trap. Pack -2.

Creature Sizes and Characteristics
----------------------------------

For each creature, roll 2d6 for its Size and apply any Dice Modifiers from its Terrain or Movement category. The creature’s Size determines its Weight, Strength, Dexterity and Endurance – for example, a roll of 7 means that the creature has a Strength of 3d6, an Dexterity of 3d6 and an Endurance of 3d6. Roll 2d6 separately for the animal’s Weapons and Armour. Add a +8 DM when rolling for weapons if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it is an Omnivore; subtract a -6 DM if the animal is a Herbivore. Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other weapons. If a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the number of damage dice the creature rolls.

Roll 2d6+DMs for the animal’s Instinct and Pack. Intelligence for most animals is 0 or 1. All animals have at least Survival 0, Athletics 0 and Recon 0, and most will have 1d6 ranks split among these skills, Melee (natural weapons), and any skills listed in their behaviour. Damage from attacks depends on the creature’s Strength score.

Environmental Dangers
=====================

Diseases
--------

Diseases reduce a character’s Characteristics, usually Endurance. The character must make an Endurance check with the listed DM   to resist the effects of the disease. If the character fails the Endurance check then he takes the listed damage and must make another Endurance check a few hours or days later, depending on the interval of the disease. Once an Endurance check has been passed, the character has fought off the disease.

Disease           | DM  | Damage | Interval  |
-----------------:|:---:|:------:|:---------:|
Pneumonia         | +0  | 1d6+4  | 1d6 weeks |
Anthrax           | -3  | 1d6+2  | 1d6 days  |
Regina Flu        | +1  | 1d6-2  | 1d6 days  |
Biological Weapon | -6  | 1d6+8  | 1d6 hours |

Poisons
-------

Poisons operate in the same way as diseases, but generally work much faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons do not have an interval but apply their damage immediately.

Poison     | DM   | Damage 
----------:|:----:|:-------
Arsenic    | -2   | 2d6
Tranq Gas  | -1d6 | Unconscious if Endurance check is failed
Neurotoxin | -4   | 1d6 Intelligence

Extremes of Temperature
-----------------------

Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage unless the characters are suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

Heat                    | Effect 
-----------------------:|:----------
50°   (Very hot desert) | 1d6/hour
200°         (≈Mercury) | 1d6/round
500°           (≈Venus) | 2d6/round
Burning Torch           | 1d6/round
Welding Torch           | 2d6/round
Inferno                 | 3d6/round

Weather
-------

High winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative Dice Modifier of -1 to -4 to all skill checks.

Falling
-------

A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1d6 damage per two metres fallen. High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or decrease the damage. Look up the size code for the world and the gravity level associated with it and multiply the falling damage by the gravity number.

Fatigue
-------

A fatigued character suffers a -2 DM to all checks until he rests. The amount of rest needed is 3 – the character’s Endurance DM hours . If a character suffers fatigue while already fatigued they fall unconscious.

Unconsciousness
---------------

An unconscious character may make an Endurance check after every minute of unconsciousness – if successful, he regains consciousness. If he fails he must wait another minute and can then try again with a +1 DM on the check for every check previously failed.

Healing
=======


Injury and Recovery
-------------------

Injured characters are either wounded or seriously wounded. A character is considered seriously wounded if he has lost at least one point from all three of his physical characteristics. As soon as one of his physical characteristics is restored, no matter how, he is no longer seriously wounded. Seriously wounded characters who have somehow avoided unconsciousness cannot move except to hobble or crawl along at 1.5 metres per combat round. They also lose their minor action in combat. Wounded characters heal naturally and can also benefit from medical care. When characteristic points return from healing, players may choose which characteristic regains the points and may split healing between characteristics if they wish.

Natural Healing
---------------

An injured character regains a number of characteristic points equal to his 1d6 + Endurance DM per day of full rest. If the character continues an active lifestyle he only heals a number of characteristic points equal to 1 + Endurance DM per day. Characters with a low Endurance DM (quite possibly from injury) may degrade (lose more characteristic points) over time if they are unlucky or cannot (or will not) rest. A seriously wounded character only regains characteristic points equal to his Endurance DM per day of rest, which means that the character may never heal naturally and will even get worse if his Endurance DM is currently negative.

Medical Treatment
-----------------

**First Aid**: Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic points equal to twice the Effect of the Medic check. Points restored by first aid are divided as desired among all damaged physical characteristics. First aid must be applied within five minutes of the injuries being received to be fully effective. A character can still benefit from first aid up to an hour after their injury but they only receive a number of characteristic points equal to the Effect of the Medic check. Performing first aid on yourself is a Difficult (-2) task. 

**Surgery**: A character who is seriously wounded (after first aid has been applied) requires surgery. Surgery restores characteristic points just like first aid but if the check is failed the patient loses characteristic points equal to the Effect. Surgery requires a hospital or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level the patient can benefit from medical care. Surgery does not benefit characters who are not seriously wounded. Performing surgery on yourself is a Very Difficult (-4) task. 

**Medical Care**: Medical care restores 2 + the character’s Endurance DM + the doctor’s Medic skill in characteristic points per day, divided evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a hospital or sickbay and for the patient to undergo full bed rest. 

**Augmentation and Medical Care**: Cybernetic or genetic augments can interfere with medical treatment. All medical care or surgery Medic rolls treating a character suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant.

Healing and Mental Characteristics
----------------------------------

Other than Psionic Strength, characters may also suffer damage to their Intelligence or even their Education. Unless otherwise specified, each mental characteristic heals at the rate of one point per day.

Sample Patrons
==============

Each patron encounter lists:

* The patron’s name and role.
* The skills and resources required to complete the mission.
* The suggested reward for the mission.
* The mission as described to the characters.

What’s really going on. Several possible variants will be presented – either pick or roll for which is the real situation.

Jefri haut-Oschem, Planetologist
--------------------------------

**Required**: Life Sciences, Survival; Spacecraft. **Reward**: Cr. 2,000/day plus expenses.

Players’ Information
--------------------

His Excellency haut-Oschem is a respected Planetologist, specialising in worlds that are nearly habitable. A planet might be a little too cold, or too dry, or be infested with a lethal native species. Haut-Oschem’s genius is in making tiny changes to a planet’s ecosystem or climate. All too often, a change can ripple out through the complex balances of a planetary environment and have unforeseen consequences. Haut-Oschem requires a spacecraft and a crew trained in the sciences for a brief period of research – no more than a few weeks, possibly a month or two. While haut-Oschem has worked with the Scout Service in the past, this mission is entirely under the aegis of private research. The ship will be visiting worlds outside settled space.

Referee’s Information
---------------------

Any character with contacts in the Scout service can find out that haut-Oschem has quarrelled with the Survey section, and that his once-stellar career has dark clouds hanging over it. Something has gone wrong…

1.  Haut-Oschem has been replaced in the eyes of the Scout service by a younger researcher, Harad Leish. Old haut-Oschem wants to prove that his theories and methodologies are still valid. Leish and a laboratory ship from the Scout Service are currently surveying a jungle world inhabited by numerous hostile species. To prove his worth, haut-Oschem needs to find a way for humans to live safely on the world before the Scout service do.
2.  As above, but haut-Oschem is bitter, and his real plan is to sabotage Leish’s survey team.
3.  Haut-Oschem has discovered that he made a terrible mistake at the start of his career. He approved the settlement of a world before he fully understood the ecosystem. Every few centuries, a species of carnivorous locusts hatches in vast swarms and devours everything in their path. The characters need to find a way to stop the insects from hatching.
4.  As above, but haut-Oschem wants to preserve his reputation above all else. The characters need to stop the insects without revealing what they’re doing to the settlers.
5.  Haut-Oschem discovered something very valuable on his most recent survey, such as a massive deposit of precious metals or alien technology. He wants the characters to help him recover it.
6.  As above, but haut-Oschem is in a race with the Scout service. He’s not the only one to have read between the lines in his latest survey.

Equipment
=========

Each item is listed with the Technology Level needed to manufacture it, its mass (in kg) and its cost. If an item’s mass or cost is not listed, then its mass or cost is negligible.

Credits
-------

The Credit (Cr.) is the standard unit of currency in Traveller. Larger denominations include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000 Credits) and the MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits).

Armour
------

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can be worn at a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armour is next applied to the inner layer. Some armours have a required skill. A character suffers a -2 DM to all actions taken in the armour per missing skill level, including level 0. 

**Jack (TL 1)**: A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs. 

**Mesh (TL 6)**: A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets. 

**Cloth (TL 7)**: A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armour is highly useful and versatile – it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice something unusual. 

**Flak Jacket (TL 7)**: A less expensive version of ballistic cloth, the bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably military garment. 

**Vacc Suit (TL 8)**: The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer’s best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum, for six hours. 

**Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8)**: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites, and high pressure environments like undersea trenches. 

**Ablat (TL 9)**: A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armour is made from a material that ablates (vaporises) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat reduces its armour value (versus lasers) by one, but the armour is cheap and easily replaceable. 

**Reflec (TL 10)**: Reflec armour is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armour. 

**Combat Armour (TL 11)**: This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armour protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life support for six hours. 

**Battle Dress (TL 13)**: The ultimate personal armour, battle dress is a powered form of combat armour. The servomotors vastly increase the user’s speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while wearing the armour. Damage to the wearer’s characteristics is calculated as normal, but the values from the armour are used for all other purposes such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in computer/2 running an Expert Tactics (military)/2 program to give tactical advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full protection against environmental hazards – including NBC shielding – as if it was an HEV suit. TL 14 battle dress is considerably stronger, giving Strength +6 instead of +4, and upgrades its internal systems to Computer/3 (although still running Tactics 2).

#### Options

Most of the options listed here can also be applied to normal clothing at the same cost. The exceptions are extended life support and grav assist. 

**Eye Protection (TL 6)**: Many armours include eye protection such as visors or goggles to guard against flying debris but such protection becomes absolutely vital at TL 9 to guard against the blinding effects of lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armour and is included for free in any TL 9+ armour. Cr 50. 

**Magnetic Grapples (TL 8)**: Magnetic plates in the boots of the armour allow the user to walk normally on a spacecraft without artificial gravity. Cr. 100. 

**Computer Weave (TL 10)**: Computer weave can be added to any armour that does not already have a computer system, and gives Computer/0 to that armour. Cr 500. 

**Extended Life Support (TL 10)**: This upgrade can be added to any suit that provides life support (vacc suit, HEV suit, combat armour, battle dress). By adding high-pressure oxygen tanks and recycling systems, the suit now provides eighteen hours of oxygen. Cr. 10,000. 

**Medikit (TL 10)**: An internal medical scanner and drug injector, the medikit can be installed in combat armour, battle dress or a vacc suit. It automatically applies first aid if the wearer is reduced to Endurance 0 (treat the Medikit as having Medic 3). It can also administer Fast Drug on command, or if life support systems are failing (turning remaining minutes of life support into hours). Cr 5,000. A TL 11 medikit can also inject Combat or Slow drugs and the Slow Drug antidote on command. Cr 10,000. 

**Smart Fabric (TL 10)**: Smart fabric resists stains and dirt, cleaning itself automatically. Cr. 1,000. 

**IR Chameleon (TL 12)**: IR (infra-red) chameleon technology can be added to any full-body suit of clothing or armour. It selectively bleeds heat to match background IR levels and effectively renders the wearer invisible to IR (Very Difficult (-4) to detect with sensors). IR Chameleon costs Cr. 5,000. 

**Grav Assist (TL 12)**: This upgrade can be added to combat armour or battle dress only, and adds the functionality of a grav belt to the armour at the cost of Cr. 110,000. The TL 15 version lasts longer. Costs Cr 120,000. 

**Vislight Chameleon (TL 13)**: A more advanced form of IR Chameleon, Vislight Chameleon covers the surface of the armour with light-bending technology, making the wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye (+4 DM to Stealth rolls). Vislight Chameleon costs Cr. 50,000.

Augments
--------

Augmentation can bring characteristics above the normal maximum for a race. Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All long-term care or surgery Medic rolls treating an augmented character suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For example, a character with TL 15 Endurance implants being treated in a TL 10 hospital would give a -5 DM to the surgeon’s Medic skill checks. 

**Neural Comm (TL 10)**: A neural comm has identical capacities to a standard comm, but the cost is much higher and the TL is increased by 2. For example, an audio-only comm costs 250 Credits and is TL 10. A character can access the capabilities of a neural comm by thought alone but must still make any relevant skill checks and must still speak aloud to send audio messages.

 Tech Level | Notes                              | Credits
-----------:|:----------------------------------:|:----------
TL 10       | Audio only                         | Cr. 1,000
TL 12       | Audio and visual, Computer/0       | Cr. 5,000
TL 14       | Multiple forms of data, Computer/1 | Cr. 20,000

**Subdermal Armour (TL 10)**: Adds a mesh of ballistic fibres to the skin and reinforces the bones, giving the character extra armour. Subdermal armour stacks with other protection.

 Tech Level |  Notes   | Credits 
-----------:|:--------:|:------------
TL 10       | Armour 1 | Cr. 50,000 
TL 11       | Armour 3 | Cr. 100,000 

**Physical Characteristic Augmentation (TL 11)**: A character’s Endurance, Strength or Dexterity can be increased in various ways, from replacing motor neurons with faster synthetic cells, to reinforcing bones and replacing organs with tougher vat-grown clones. Augmentations must be purchased for each characteristic separately.

 Tech Level |  Notes            | Credits 
-----------:|:-----------------:|:------------
TL 11       | Characteristic +1 | Cr. 500,000 
TL 12       | Characteristic +2 | Cr. 1,000,000 
TL 15       | Characteristic +3 | Cr. 5,000,000 

**Augmentation (TL 12)**: Replacing slow nerve cells with faster synthetic substrates and implanting optoelectronic boosters can increase the speed at which a character thinks, effectively boosting his Intelligence.

 Tech Level |  Notes            | Credits 
-----------:|:-----------------:|:------------
TL 12       | Intelligence +1   | Cr. 500,000 
TL 14       | Intelligence +2   | Cr. 1,000,000 
TL 16       | Intelligence +3   | Cr. 5,000,000 

**Skill Augmentation (TL 12)**: The character’s nervous system is rewired to be more suited to a particular task. A pilot might have his reflexes and sense of balance improved; a broker might be made capable of controlling his pupil responses and smelling the pheromones and skin salinity of the other party. A skill augmentation gives the character a +1 DM when using that skill. Cr. 50,000. A character can only have one skill augmentation and must possess that skill at level 0 to benefit from the augmentation. 

**Wafer Jack (TL 12)**: A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the base of the skull that consists of an external data socket and a processor running an interface program. A character with a wafer jack can use expert programs for tasks relying on Intelligence or Education only. The main benefit of the jack is that it is much smaller and more discrete than a hand computer, and the user can access the expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack is a Computer/2 (Computer/4 at TL 13) and can only run expert programs. It is always running Intelligent Interface at no cost. Cr. 10,000. (Cr. 15,000 at TL 13.) 

**Enhanced Vision (TL 13)**: A character can be implanted with cybernetic eyes giving him the abilities of a set of binoculars and IR/ Light Intensifier goggles at the cost of Cr. 25,000.

Communications
--------------

**Bug (TL 5)**: Surveillance devices such as hidden microphones and tiny cameras, bugs are available from TL 5 onwards. They rapidly miniaturise and become more intelligent. A TL 14 bug can be no bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though, the shorter its range – a bug that transmits data needs a much larger power supply than one that just records until it is collected.

TL 5 | Audio | Cr. 50 |
TL 7 | Audio or Visual | Cr. 100 |
TL 9 | Audio or Visual or Data | Cr. 200 |
TL 11 | Audio/Visual/Data | Cr. 300 |
TL 13 | Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan | Cr. 400 |
TL 15 | Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan/Computer/1 | Cr. 500 |

**Audio**: The bug records anything it hears. **Visual**: The bug records anything it sees. **Data**: If attached to a computer system, the bug can search and copy data from the computer. The bug cannot breach computer security on its own, but if a user accesses the computer in the bug’s presence, the bug can read his data. **Bioscan**: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing it to sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so forth. **Computer/1**: The bug has an onboard computer system with Computer/1. A bug can be active or passive. An active bug transmits data (either constantly, or when triggered). Passive bugs just record until activated. **Transceiver (TL 5)**: A transceiver is a stand-alone communications device. Unlike a comm, which relies on the presence of an established communications network, a transceiver can send and receive directly under its own power. To reach orbit reliably, a transceiver needs a range of 500 kilometres.

| Radio Transcievers | Mass (kg) | Range | Cost (Cr.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TL 5 | 20  | Distant (5km) | 50  |
| TL 8 | 2   | Distant (5km) | 100 |
| TL 9 (Computer/0) | 1   | Very Distant (50km) | 250 |
| TL 12 (Computer/0) | 1   | Regional (500km) | 500 |
| TL 13 (Computer/1) | 1   | Continental (5,000km) | 1,000 |

| TL 9 | 1.5 | Regional (500km) | 100 |
| TL 11 (Computer/0) | 0.5 | Regional (500km) | 250 |
| TL 13 (Computer/1) | –   | Regional (500km) | 500 |

**Comm (TL 6)**: A personal comm unit is a portable telecommunications device/computer/camera, ranging in size from a bulky handset to a slim watch or pen-like cylinder. Larger comms have physical controls and screens, while smaller units either project data and control displays onto nearby surfaces, have fold-out plastic screens, or connect to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range transmission and reception capabilities, but most technologically advanced worlds will have planet-wide comm networks allowing the user to send messages and access data anywhere.

| TL 6 | Audio only | Cr. 50 |
| TL 8 | Audio and visual, Computer/0 | Cr. 150 |
| TL 10 | Multiple forms of data, Computer/1 | Cr. 500 |

**Commdot (TL 10)**: A commdot is a tiny microphone/speaker and transmitter, ranging in size between a few centimetres and a few millimetres across. A commdot is capable of interfacing with another communications device and relaying messages back and forth. Commdots have a range of only a few metres. They are usually used as hands-free communicators, but can also be used as improvised bugs or throat microphones. Cr. 10 each. **Holographic Projector (TL 11)**: A holographic projector is a toaster-sized box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image in the space around it or nearby – the range is approximately three metres in all directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations within a limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used for communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough to fool anyone who fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing the hologram) and the TL 13 version can produce holograms that are true-to-life images.

Computers
---------

The power of a computer is given by its rating (Computer/1, Computer/2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating. The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above. Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8.

| Optimum TL | Computer Power | Mass (kg) | Cost (Cr.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TL 7 | Computer/0 | 10  | 50  |
| TL 8 | Computer/1 | 5   | 100 |
| TL 9 | Computer/1 | 5   | 250 |
| TL 10 | Computer/2 | 1   | 350 |
| TL 11 | Computer/2 | 1   | 500 |
| TL 12 | Computer/3 | 0.5 | 1,000 |
| TL 13 | Computer/4 | 0.5 | 1,500 |
| TL 14 | Computer/5 | 0.5 | 5,000 |

**Computer Terminal (TL 7)**: This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Computer/0, and costs Cr. 200. **Hand Computer (TL 7)**: A hand computer is a portable computer system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other.

#### Options

**Data Display/Recorder (TL 13)**: This headpiece worn over one or both eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results and so forth. Cr. 5,000. **Data Wafer (TL 10)**: The principle medium of information storage is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Cr 5. **Specialized Computer**: A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only. The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Computer/1, but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialised computer costs 25% more per added rating. In addition, running the program a computer is specialised for does not use up rating when working out how many programs the computer can run simultaneously.

#### Software

A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a minimum of the lowest rating shown. Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

| Intellect | 1   | TL 12 | Cr. 2,000 |
| 2   | TL 13 | Cr. 50,000 |
| 3   | TL 14 | –   |

**Database**: A database is a large store of information on a topic that can be searched with a Computer check or using an Agent. **Interface**: Displays data. Using a computer without an interface is a Formidable (-6 DM) task. **Security**: Security programs defend against intrusion. Rating 0 is Average (+0 DM).

* Difficult (-2 DM) difficulty
* Very Difficult (-4 DM) difficulty
* Formidable (-6 DM) difficulty

**Translator**: Translators are specialised Expert systems that only have Language skills. The TL 9 version just provides a near-real-time translation. The TL 10 works in real-time and has a much better understanding of the nuances of language. **Intrusion**: Intrusion programs aid hacking attempts, giving a bonus equal to their rating. Intrusion software is often illegal. **Intelligent Interface**: Artificial intelligence allows voice control and displays data intelligently. Required for using Expert programs. **Expert**: Expert programs mimic skills. A character using an expert system may make a skill check as if he had the skill at the program’s rating -1. Only Intelligence and Education-based checks can be attempted. If the character already has the skill at a higher level then an Expert program grants a +1 DM instead. **Agent**: Agent programs have a Computer skill equal to their rating, and can carry out tasks assigned to them with a modicum of intelligence. For example, an agent program might be commanded to hack into an enemy computer system and steal a particular data file. They are effectively specialised combinations of Computer Expert and Intellect programs. **Intellect**: Intellects are improved agents, who can use Expert systems. For example, a robot doctor might be running Intellect/1 and Expert Medic/3, giving it a Medic skill of 2. An Intellect program can use a number of skills simultaneously equal to its Rating.

Medical Supplies
----------------

**Cryoberth (TL 10)**: A cryoberth, or ‘icebox’, is a coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths used on some spacecraft. A cryoberth can be used to place a severely injured character into stasis until he receives medical treatment. While in a cryoberth, a character’s wounds neither heal nor degrade and all disease and poison activity is halted. A cryoberth’s internal power system can function for up to one week on its own, but a berth is usually connected to a vehicle’s power supply. Wt. 200 kg, Cr. 50,000. **Medikit (TL 8+)** There are different types of medikit available at different Technology Levels. All medikits contain diagnostic devices and scanners, surgical tools and a panoply of drugs and antibiotics, allowing a medic to practise his art in the field. Higher-technology medikits do not give a bonus to basic treatment, but can help with more exotic problems or when treating augmented individuals. For example, a TL 8 medikit can test blood pressure and temperature (among other things); a TL 14 kit has a medical densitometer to create a three-dimensional view of the patient’s body and can scan brain activity on the quantum level. All medikits weigh 8 kg.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| TL 8 | Cr 1,000 |
| TL 10 | Cr 1,500 |
| TL 12 | Cr 5,000 |
| TL 14 | Cr 10,000 |

### Drugs

**Medicinal Drugs (TL 5+)** include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from five credits to several thousand credits, depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (-2 DM) poison with a damage of 1d6. **Panaceas (TL 8+)** are wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Panaceas cost 200 credits per dose. **Anti-rad drugs (TL 8)** must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day – taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1d6 per dose. Cr. 1,000 per dose. **Stim drugs (TL 8)** remove fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on. Stims cost 50 credits per dose. **Metabolic accelerator (‘Slow Drug’, TL 10)** boosts the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He suffers 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted. Metabolic accelerator costs 500 credits per dose. **Combat Drug (TL 10)**: This drug increases reaction time and improves the body’s ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued. Combat drugs cost 1,000 credits per dose. **Medicinal Slow (TL 11)** is a variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day. Medicinal slow costs 500 credits per dose. **Fast Drug (TL 10)** or ‘Hibernation’ puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth. Fast drug costs 200 credits per dose. **Anagathics (TL 15)** slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. They cost 2,000 Credits per dose. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect – if the character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted supply.

#### Medical Care

**Healing**: An injured character who needs hospital care for a prolonged period will pay approximately 100 credits per month per Technology Level. (At TL 11+ the doctors will just use medicinal slow in most cases and charge for that instead.) Surgery costs 1d6 x 50 x Technology Level in Credits. **Replacements**: A character whose injuries require cloning limbs or cybernetic replacement must pay 5,000 credits per Characteristic point.

Robots and Drones
-----------------

A robot has an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with the Remote Operations skill. Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot’s Education characteristic is representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his own Social Standing score. **Cargo Robot (TL 11)**: These simple, heavy-duty robots are found in starport docks and on board cargo ships. Cargo drones can be constructed as low as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited until the invention of Intellect programs.

* Strength 30 (+8), Dexterity 9 (+1), Hull 2, Structure 2
* Intelligence 3 (-1), Education 5 (-1), Social Standing 0 (-3)

* _Price_: 75,000 Credits

**Repair Robot (TL 11)**: Shipboard repair robots are small crab-shaped machines that carry a variety of welding and cutting tools. Specialised repair robots may run Expert Engineer (any) rather than Expert Mechanic.

* Strength 6 (+0), Dexterity 7 (+0), Hull 1, Structure 1
* Intelligence 5 (-1), Education 6 (+0), Social Standing 0 (-3)
* _Traits_: Integral System (mechanical toolkit), Specialised Computer/1 (running Intellect/1 and Expert Mechanic/2)
* _Weapons_: Tools (Melee (unarmed), 1d6 damage)
* _Price_: 10,000 Credits

**Personal Drone (TL 11)**: This is a small floating globe about thirty centimetres in diameter. It is equipped with holographic projectors which can display the image of a person, allowing a character to have a virtual presence over a great distance.

* Strength 2 (-2), Dexterity 7 (+0), Hull 1, Structure 1
* _Traits_: Tiny, Integral System (comm, audio/visual), Integral System (grav floater), Integral System (TL 11 holographic projector)

* _Traits_: Armour 5, Integral System (comm, audio/visual), Integral System (grav belt), Integral System (TL 11 holographic projector), Integral System (every sensor available at TL 11 and below)
* _Price_: 15,000 Credits

**Autodoc (TL 12)**: An autodoc is a specialised, immobile medical robot, which is often installed inside vehicles or spacecraft.

* Strength 6 (+0), Dexterity 15 (+3), Hull 1, Structure 1
* Intelligence 9 (+1), Education 12 (+2), Social Standing 0 (-3)

* _Weapons_: Surgical Tools (Melee (small blade), 1d6 damage)
* _Price_: 40,000 Credits

**Combat Drone (TL 12)**: Combat drones are little more than flying guns mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The drones must be piloted with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect and combat Expert programs (making them autonomous combat robots) are illegal on many worlds.

* Strength 12 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+1), Hull 4, Structure 4
* _Traits_: Armour 9, Integral System (grav floater), Integral Weapon (any)
* _Weapons_: Any gun
* _Price_: 90,000 Credits plus the cost of the weapon (the Integral Weapon upgrade is included)

**Servitor (TL 13)**: Servitor robots are expensive humanoid robots who are programmed to act as butlers or servants to the nobility. Some servitor owners reprogram their robots with Expert Carouse or Expert Gambler to better suit their lifestyle.

* Strength 7 (+0), Dexterity 9 (+1), Hull 2, Structure 2
* Intelligence 9 (+1), Education 12 (+2), Social Standing 7 (+0)
* _Traits_: Computer/3 (running Intellect/1 and Expert Steward/2 – servitors also have Expert Diplomacy/2 and Translator/1 available should they be necessary)
* _Weapons_: Robot Punch (Melee (unarmed), 1d6 damage)
* _Price_: 120,000 Credits

#### Options

**Armour**: Armour can be increased by 5, which increases the drone or robot’s cost by 25%. **Integral System**: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices include toolkits of different kinds, various sensors, or mobility upgrades like thruster packs or grav floaters. **Integral Weapon**: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or robot, at the cost of Cr. 10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

Sensors
-------

At TL 11 sensors become notably more discriminating because they can be hooked up to a system running Intellect/1 that can dynamically filter information based on pre-set parameters – not sounding the alarm if the motion sensor picks up anything too small to be an intruder, for example. Sensor equipment does not offer a bonus to skill checks but allows the user to find things that they would otherwise not be able to. **Binoculars (TL 3)**: Allows the user to see further. 1 kg, Cr. 75. At TL 8 electronic enhancement allows images to be captured; light-intensification allows them to be used in the dark. Cr 750. At TL 12 PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System) allows the user to observe a large section of the EM-spectrum, from infrared to gamma rays. Cr 3,500. **Geiger Counter (TL 5)**: Detects radiation, both presence and approximate intensity. Cr. 250. The Sensors skill is not needed to detect the presence of radiation with a Geiger counter but anything more complex than that requires a check. **IR Goggles (TL 6)**: Permits the user to see exothermic (heat-emitting) sources in the dark. Cr. 500. **Light-Intensifying Goggles (TL 7)**: Permits the user to see normally in anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any available light. Cr. 500. At TL 9, IR goggles and light-intensifying goggles can be combined into a single unit costing Cr. 1,250. **Motion Sensor (TL 7)**: A motion sensor simply detects any and all movement within the area assigned to it. It cannot differentiate between kinds of movement, it just reports whether there is movement or not in an area roughly six metres in diameter. Cr. 500. At TL 9 the motion detector can report the general qualities of motion – size, speed and duration – but no more. Cr. 1,000. The Sensors skill is not required to use a motion detector to detect motion. When trying to interpret data from a TL 9 motion sensor, the Sensors skill may need to be checked. **Electromagnetic Probe (TL 10)**: This handy device detects the electromagnetic emissions of technological devices, and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs or devices. Cr 1,000. The Sensors or Investigation skills can be used to sweep a room for bugs. **Densitometer (TL 14)**: The remote densitometer uses an object’s natural gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of the inside and outside of an object. 5 kg. Cr. 20,000. **Bioscanner (TL 15)**: The bioscanner ‘sniffs’ for organic molecules and tests chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focussed on. It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. 3.5 kg. Cr. 350,000. The data from a bioscanner can be interpreted using the Sensors or the Life Sciences (biology) skills. **NAS (TL 15)**: This device consists of a backpack and detachable handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500 metres away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. 10 kg. Cr 35,000. The data from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using the Sensors, the Life Sciences (biology) or the Social Sciences (sophontology)

Survival Gear and Supplies
--------------------------

**Tent (TL 3)**: A basic tent provides shelter for two people against the weather, reducing skill check penalties by 2. Cr. 200. The TL 7 tent can be pressurised. There is no airlock – the tent is depressurised when opened. Cr 2,000. **Rebreather (TL 6)**: The rebreather is a bulky backpack containing breathable atmosphere and a face mask that collects exhaled gasses and ‘scrubs’ them back into breathable gasses again. A rebreather provides six hours of breathable atmosphere and can be used to breathe in any environment that is not otherwise harmful, such as underwater. 10 kg, Cr. 250. **Respirator (TL 6)**: This device concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing a character to breathe on worlds with a thin atmosphere. Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece initially. Cr. 100. The more advanced TL 10 respirator is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000. **Filter (TL 7)**: Filters are breathing masks that strip out harmful elements from the air inhaled by the character, such as dangerous gases or dust particles. Cr 100. The TL 10 filter is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000. **Breather Mask (TL 8)**: Combines the filter and respirator into a single package. Cr. 150. **Artificial Gill (TL 8)**: Extracts oxygen from water allowing the wearer to breathe underwater. Only works on worlds with breathable atmospheres (type 4-9). 4 kg. Cr 4,000. **Environment Suit (TL 8)**: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in normal operations. Costs Cr 500. **Habitat Module (TL 8)**: A modular, unpressurised quarters for six people, capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane-force winds. Includes survival rations and enough batteries to keep the lights on and the heaters (or air conditioning) running for a week. Requires 12 man-hours to assemble, and can be attached to other modules to form a base. Cr 10,000. The TL 10 module is pressurised, and includes life-support for six occupants for one week (1000 person/hours). Cr 20,000. **Rescue Bubble (TL 9)**: A large (2m diameter) pressurised plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user’s movements into electricity to recharge the bubble’s batteries and power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space and sea vessels as emergency lifeboats. Cr. 600. **Thruster Pack (TL 9)**: A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at Adjacent range. Cr. 2,000. At TL 12 the long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g acceleration for up to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. This increases its practical range on the spacecraft scale to Short but gives it a weight of 10 kg. Cr. 14,000. The TL 14 version of the long-range pack is much smaller as it uses grav-thruster plates instead, but has the same performance profile as the TL 12 version. Cr. 20,000. **Portable Generator (TL 10)**: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator, capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for up to one month of use. Cr. 500,000.

### Options

**Self-Assembling (TL 11)**: The self-assembling upgrade can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures. The structure is capable of expanding and assembling itself with only minimal aid, reducing the time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour. Cr. 5,000. **Self-Sealing (TL 13)**: Structures can be made self-repairing and self-sealing at TL 13 for Cr. 2,000. Small breaches and rips are automatically fixed in seconds.

#### Toolkits

Technical skills require specialist tools of various kinds. These kits contain diagnostic sensors, hand tools, computer analysis programs and spare parts. All kits cost Cr. 1,000 and weigh 12 kg. **Engineer (specific specialty)**: Required for performing repairs and installing new equipment. **Forensics**: Required for investigating crime scenes and testing samples. **Mechanical**: Required for repairs and construction. **Scientific**: Required for scientific testing and analysis. **Surveying**: Required for planetary surveys or mapping.

Weapons
-------

Weapons are described with the following statistics: **TL**: The lowest Technology Level at which the weapon is available. **Range**: The range modifiers used for that weapon. **Damage**: The damage the weapon inflicts. **Auto**: The Auto rating of the weapon if it is capable of automatic fire. **Recoil**: The Recoil rating of the weapon. **Mass**: The amount, in kilograms, that the weapon weighs on a world with Earth-like gravity. **Magazine**: The number of shots the weapon can take before needing to be reloaded or connected to a new power pack. Unless specified otherwise in the weapon’s description it takes only a single minor action to reload or two to switch to a new power pack. **Cost**: The weapon’s cost in credits. **Ammo Cost/Power Pack**: The cost in credits to buy a spare magazine for a gun or a spare power pack for an energy weapon.

#### Melee Weapons

**Blade**: A hybrid knife weapon, somewhere between a dagger and a cutlass, with a large basket hilt. **Broadsword**: A heavy two-handed sword. **Cutlass**: The standard shipboard blade weapon, often kept near airlocks to repel boarders. **Rapier**: A character using a rapier increases their effective Melee (large blade) skill by one level when parrying. **Club**: Whether a handy length of metal piping or an extending riot baton made of advanced polymers, the club remains a popular and practical weapon wherever intelligent species gather. **Dagger**: Daggers are especially suited to close-quarters combat – while grappling someone armed with a dagger can do Effect + 4 damage if they choose to hurt their opponent. **Improvised Weapon**: When there’s no real weapon available and your bare hands just aren’t enough, any snatched-up object can be used as an impromptu club. **Shield**: A character using a shield increases their effective Melee (unarmed) skill by one level when parrying. A character with no Melee counts as having Melee 0 when using a shield to parry. **Staff**: A length of wood or metal that can be used in a variety of combat styles, to aid walking, or to poke potentially dangerous things from a distance. **Stunstick**: This melee weapon deals 2d6 stun damage in addition to its normal damage. A character struck by a stun stick must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the stun damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the character is knocked unconscious.

#### Slug Throwers

**Accelerator Rifle**: Also known as gyrojet weapons, accelerator rifles are designed for zero-gravity combat. They fire tiny missiles that leave the rifle with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then accelerate to high speed. **Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)**: The ultimate evolution of the conventional firearm, advanced combat rifles are the weapon of choice for many military units. Standard equipment includes an electronic battlefield sight, incorporating both light amplification and IR abilities, visual magnification up to 5x zoom, and a laser rangefinder which may also be used as a target painting device (reveals exact distance to target). The weapon is also gyroscopically stabilised during firing. **Antique Pistol**: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique pistols require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug pistol) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again. **Antique Rifle**: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique rifles require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug rifle) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again. **Assault Rifle**: Assault rifles fire lighter projectiles than rifles, but are capable of a higher rate of fire and are more suitable to short-range encounters. **Autopistol**: Variants of this semi-automatic pistol are the standard sidearm for law enforcement officers and criminals. **Autorifle**: Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle velocity and are capable of automatic fire. Also termed battle rifles. **Body Pistol**: Body pistols are manufactured from plastics and cultured bone, making them very difficult to detect using conventional weapons scanners. Body pistols increase the difficulty of Sensors checks to detect them to Very Difficult (-4). **Gauss Rifle**: Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles at TL 13. Like the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fire high-velocity projectiles using electromagnetic rails. **Gauss Pistol**: Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons are lightweight, efficient and deadly. **Revolver**: A conventional six-shooter handgun. Revolvers take two minor actions to reload. **Rifle**: Reloading a rifle requires two minor actions. **Shotgun**: A shotgun using pellet ammunition ignores Dodge dice modifiers, but Armour gives double protection against pellet attacks. A shotgun can also fire solid slugs, which follow all the normal rules for shooting. **Snub Pistol**: These lightweight, low-recoil weapons were designed for use aboard spacecraft and in zero gravity.

#### Energy Weapons

A laser that hits with Effect 6+ will permanently blind its target unless they are wearing some sort of eye protection. **Laser Carbine**: Laser carbines are shorter and lighter than laser rifles, and have a correspondingly shorter range. **Laser Pistol**: The TL 9 pistol is bulky, but effective, with no recoil and a large magazine. At TL 11, advances in battery technology and miniaturisation mean that the pistol is no larger than a conventional firearm, but must still be connected to a battery pack for sustained use. **Laser Rifle**: Laser rifles are highly accurate at long range. They are powered by heavy backpacks, although they have an internal battery that can store enough energy for six shots for mobile sniping. **Plasma Rifle**: TL 16 technology allows the bulky reactor and plasma chamber of the PGMP to be made small enough to fit into a rifle frame. The plasma rifle is a high-power sniper weapon designed to crack Battle Dress. Because of its internal reactor it never runs out of ammunition. **Stunners**: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

#### Grenades

**Aerosol**: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six metres in radius that diffusess lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser attack made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time. **Frag**: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast:

| Distance | Damage |
| --- | --- |
| 3 metres | 5d6 |
| 6 metres | 3d6 |
| 9 metres | 1d6 |

**Smoke**: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a -2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time. **Stun**: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

#### Heavy Weapons

**Grenade Launcher**: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances. **RAM Grenade Launcher**: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full auto; unlike other weapons with an Auto score, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher. **Rocket Launcher**: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive backblast. Anyone up to 1.5 metres behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3d6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person. It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher. The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six metres of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1d6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect metres away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating. **PGMP**: It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s Strength falls short is a -1 DM on any attack rolls made with it. **FGMP**: It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2d6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity.

#### Explosives

The Explosives skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the Explosives skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of x1 damage for an Effect of 0 or 1. **Plastic**: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favourite of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across known space. **TDX**: An advanced gravity-polarised explosive, TDX explodes only along the horizontal axis. **Pocket Nuke**: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke is actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a grenade launcher.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Explosives
| Weapon | TL  | Damage | Radius | Cost (Cr.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plastic | 6   | 3d6 | 2d6 metres | 200 |
| TDX | 12  | 4d6 | 4d6 metres | 1,000 |
| Pocket Nuke | 12  | 2d6 x 20 | 15d6 metres | 20,000 |
